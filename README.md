This repository holds the code and lecture notes from a summer course I taught on Applied Coding for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Oceanography in the Summer of 2023.
## How to run the model
You can run the model in `scripts/2d_diffusion.py` and view the notes in `_research/notes/applied_coding_notes.pdf`.
